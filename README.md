# LIGA
# Application Developed for Tech Challenge UChicago 2022. 

### The Problem
LIGA spurred from the need at UChicago to have a portal that directly connects recruiters to specific RSOs (Recognized Student Organizations). In its current state, UChicago has many elite RSOs which have direct informal connections with employers that serve as a fundamental pipeline between the members and the employers. Unfortunately, in its current state, this pipeline is restricted to the top 1% of RSOs (evaluating by acceptance rates and popularity). These are all groups that have been around for years and have secured funding from the university and external resources —e.g., Eckhart, Blue Chips, AKPsi, and Maroon Capital. But what if we could give an easy way of establishing a career pipeline to any RSO on campus? This is exactly where LIGA comes into play.

### The Solution
Create an extremely easy tool to create a resume book that showcases every RSO's member's skills, interests, and experiences and make it intuitive and easy to share it with potential employers. The only thing the RSO has to do is have their members fill out a google forms with their information that will automatically add their profile to their resume book. When this step is done, RSO gets a key to share their “resume book” to any potential employer, which showcases each member alongside a highlighted project, resume, interests, experience. In this resume book, recruiters can filter for specific criteria, such as level of experience, area of expertise, etc. 
Imagine a future where the recently established UChicago space RSO can connect with spaceX, NASA, and Varda recruiters with a compiled version of their available talent, or the newly created BioTech group could access employers from Ginko Bioworks, Medical research labs around the world, and justly showcase UChicago worthy talent. LIGA is the way to do _this_ and much more.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
